PANCREAS VASCULOPATHY DATA PROCESSING					January 2021

The aim of this work is to calculate the degree of arterial occlusion in a series of 224 pancreas tissue slides and to derive some statistics from these measurements.

The initial annotation to generate this information is carried out using Leica Aperio ImageScope software.  The output from this annotation stage is then processed by text editing in Emacs, re-formatted using bespoke Perl scripts and the final statistical analysis carried out in Excel.

There are three stages to this work as follows:
	ANNOTATION:		generating the raw data
	ANALYSIS_STAGE_1:	calculates the percentage occlusion of four blood vessels in each 					of the 224 tissue slices
	ANALYSIS_STAGE_2:	calculates the statistics for the four blood vessels in each tissue slice



ANNOTATION
On each tissue slide, four blood vessels are annotated.  For each blood vessel, three lines are drawn in order to define (a) the outer blood vessel wall, (b) the inner vessel wall and (c) the boundary of any occluding material in the lumen of the blood vessel. The software calculates the areas enclosed within each of these three lines and puts the data into an Excel file.  From these area figures, the percentage occlusion of the blood vessel can be determined.

Examples of an annotated blood vessel can be seen in file ‘Annotation_Example.jpg’ and the figures determined from this can be seen in the file ‘Annotation_Example_Output.xlsx’.

The format of the ImageScope Excel files is not ideal for calculating the % occlusion and the subsequent statistics.   The subsequent steps aim to convert this output into a format more amenable to such analysis. This is done in two stages.



ANALYSIS_STAGE_1
The overall aim in STAGE_1 of the analysis is to determine the percentage occlusion for four blood vessels on each slide. 

To do this, the Excel files are converted to *.txt files and combined into a single text file.  A Perl script then takes this file and combines the three lines of data for each blood vessel onto a single line.  The output file is opened in Excel, edited to remove unwanted columns and the % occlusion for each blood vessel is calculated.  The final Excel file for this stage (Vasculopathy_All_Stage_1_v3.xlsx) is shown and each line shows the % occlusion for a single blood vessel.

The steps in Stage 1 analysis are as follows:

	1.	Rename *.xls.xlsx files to *.xlsx
	2.	Convert the *.xlsx files to *.csv files.
	3.	Concatenate the *.csv files
	4.	Edit the concatenated file
	5.	Run the 'vasculopathy.pl' script
	6.	Open output file in Excel and calculate vasculopathy scores

# STEPS 1-5 ARE DONE IN UNIX/LINUX ENVIRONMENT ON CSD3 OR EQUIVALENT


1.	RENAME *.xls.xlsx files to *.xlsx
	Open Thunar file manager in CSD3 to launch bulk rename utility:
		thunar -B
	Add files
		Select -> Open
	In boxes:
		Search & Replace
		Name and Suffix
	Search for:  .xls.xlsx
	Replace with:	.xlsx
	Rename files
	# This step shouldn't have been necessary - the *.xls.xlsx nomenclature is an annotation 	error


2.	CONVERT *.XLSX FILES TO *.CSV FILES
	Install 'csvkit' software on Linux/Unix environment (see notes)

	a). USING EMACS
	In Linux:
	ls > newfile.txt
	Open 'newfile.txt' in Emacs and edit each line to:
		'~/.local/bin/in2csv filename.xlsx > filename.csv'
	Save as 'newfile_edited.txt' and then 'source' the file:
		source newfile_edited.txt
		-> Converts all *.xlsx files to *.csv files
	
	b). ALTERNATE METHOD:
	Shell script in Linux (Bash shell):
	for i in *.xlsx; do libreoffice --headless --convert-to csv "$i"; done
	# This works on locally-installed Linux that has LibreOffice installed
		- May not work on CSD3


3.	CONCATENATE THE *.CSV FILES
	In Linux:
	ls > *.csv file_list.txt
	# Puts all *.csv filenames into single file (file_list.txt)
	Open 'file_list.txt' in Emacs and edit each line to:
		cat file_1.csv > combined_file.txt
		cat file_2.csv >> combined_file.txt
		cat file_3.csv >> combined_file.txt
		etc...

		# Note use of '>' for first line, thereafter '>>'
		# '>' creates the file, '>>' appends to the end of the file you've just created

	Save as 'file_list_edited.txt' and then 'source' the file:
		source file_list_edited.txt
		-> All *.csv files are concatenated into 'combined_file.txt'


4.	EDIT CONCATENATED FILE
	a.	Open 'combined_file.txt' in Emacs and removed header lines (begin with 'Sample...')
		Save as 'combined_file_edited.txt'

	b.	Move 'combined_file_edited.txt' to same directory as Perl script 				(vasculopathy_stage_1.pl)
		Rename to 'input_file_stage_1.txt'.



5.	RUN PERL SCRIPT (vasculopathy_stage_1.pl)
	Takes concatenated *.txt file as input. Puts the three lines of data for each blood vessel onto 	a single line.  This makes it easier to edit in Excel in order to calculate the % occlusion 	figures.
	Run script 'vasculopathy_stage_1.pl'.
		Output file is 'outfile_stage_1.txt'.
		Rename 'outfile_stage_1.txt' to 'outfile_stage_1.csv'.
		Transfer 'outfile_stage_1.csv' back to Windows laptop


6.	CALCULATE VASCULOPATHY SCORES
	Calculate % occlusion for all blood vessels in each sample
	
	Open 'outfile_stage_1.csv' in Excel
	 - Delete unneeded columns 	# Just left in as a visual check that all is as it should be
	 - Calculate 'Occluded_Area' (= total lumen area - free lumen area)
	 - Calculate '%_Occlusion' (= (occluded lumen area / total lumen area) x 100%)
	 - Save as 'Vasculopathy_All_Stage_1.xlsx'
	 - Final file, after edits, is 'Vasculopathy_All_Stage_1_v3.xlsx'
	 #This shows the vasculopathy scores for each blood vessel in a given tissue slice.
	 #There is a separate line for each blood vessel.




*****************************



ANALYSIS_STAGE_2
This stage combines the occlusion data from each of the four blood vessels in a given tissue slice into a single line, in order to calculate the aggregate vasculopathy scores for each tissue section overall. The process is broadly the same as what was done in the Stage_1, but with some differences.  The steps in Stage_2 analysis are:

	1.	Edit the output Excel file from Stage 1 ('Vasculopathy_All_Stage_1_v3.xlsx')
	2.	Move file to Unix/Linux environment
	3.	Rename input file
	4.	Run Perl script
	5.	Open output file in Excel and calculate vasculopathy scores


1.	EDIT EXCEL FILE FROM STAGE 1
	Starting file:  Vasculopathy_All_Stage_1_v3.xlsx
	Make a copy and move it to the Analysis_Stage_2 directory
		Rename as 'stage_2_input.xlsx'
		Edit to remove non-required data
			Keep only first and last columns
			Copy last column & paste as 'values'
			Delete header line
		Save as 'stage_2_input_edited.csv'
			-> this is input for script 'vasculopathy_stage_2.pl'


2. MOVE THESE FILES TO UNIX/LINUX ENVIRONMENT
		stage_2_input_edited.csv
		vasculopathy_stage_2.pl


3.	RENAME INPUT FILE FOR PERL SCRIPT
	Rename 'stage_2_input_edited.csv' to 'infile_stage_2.txt'
		mv stage_2_input_edited.csv infile_stage_2.txt
		
		# This is the filename the script looks for		
		# Might work with *.csv files - haven't tested


4.	RUN PERL SCRIPT ('vasculopathy_stage_2.pl)
Each tissue section has four annotated blood vessels. Each one of these is on a separate line, so have to work with groups of four lines per tissue slice. For each group of four lines, the script takes the first and last fields of the first line (sample ID plus first % Occlusion figure) and concatenates them with last field (% Occlusion) from remaining three lines in the group.

		Script output is 'outfile_stage_2.txt'
		Move back to laptop and rename as 'stage_2_output.csv'


5.	CALCULATE VASCULOPATHY SCORES PER TISSUE SECTION
	Calculate overall % occlusion for each tissue section
		Open 'stage_2_output.csv' in Excel
		Edit as required
		Do stats analysis
		Save as 'Vasculopathy_All_Final.xlsx'
